# testing-shebangs

To run this clone the repositroy, go into the directory you cloned it into and run:

```
./a && ./b && ./c && ./d && ./e && ./f && ./g && echo "Success"
```

If the output ends with success you can use all the shebangs in the test, if not you might want to run them individually to see which ones are breaking e.g.:

```
./a
```

Then

```
./b
```

etc.
